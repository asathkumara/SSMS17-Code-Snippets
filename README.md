# SSMS17 Code Snippets
I started this GitHub repository in a T-SQL course to teach myself Git, GitHub and improve my workflow (and the workflow of my peers) in SQL Server Management Studio 2017.

This repository contains several code snippets for T-SQL that have been formatted to match the formatting used (with some exceptions, such as the Allman bracing style) in the plugin called [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter](http://architectshack.com/PoorMansTSqlFormatter.ashx). 

## Using The Snippets

If you would like to use these custom snippets, you need to download the code and import it to SQL Server Management Studio. You can do by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/scripting/add-transact-sql-snippets?view=sql-server-2017) in Microsoft's documentation.

Feel free to change the snippet code, once you've downloaded it, to match the formatting you use. 

## Contributing Changes
If you would like to contribute to this repository and are familiar with the [code snippet schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/code-snippets-schema-reference?view=vs-2015), please get in touch with me as I'm focusing on writing snippets for very basic T-SQL statements.
