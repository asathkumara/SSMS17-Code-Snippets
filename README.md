# SSMS17 Code Snippets
I started this GitHub repository in a T-SQL course to teach myself Git, GitHub and improve my workflow (and the workflow of my peers) in SQL Server Management Studio 2017.

This repository contains several code snippets for T-SQL that have been formatted to match the formatting used (with some exceptions, such as the Allman bracing style) in the plugin called [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter](http://architectshack.com/PoorMansTSqlFormatter.ashx). 

## Using The Snippets

If you would like to use these custom snippets, you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/SSMS17-CodeSnippets/releases/tag/v1.0) the code and import it to SQL Server Management Studio. You can do so by following these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/scripting/add-transact-sql-snippets?view=sql-server-2017) in Microsoft's documentation or by using the self-extracting archive in the release.

Feel free to change the snippet code, once you've downloaded it, to match the formatting you use.
